# Weekly Update

## This Week

**Beavers:** We're meeting at the hut, doing the Space badge.
**Cubs:** Following on from last week, we're meeting at the hut for backwoods cooking. If anybody has any dietary requirements that we don't know about, please tell us so we can make sure we bring suitable food.
**Scouts:** We're doing outdoor first aid, meeting at Cherry Lane car park
**Other Stuff:** This Wednesday, we're doing some more chess. It's the second of the district warm-up events, so we're joining in with that. The Lichess event is [here](https://lichess.org/tournament/rflfdqxh) (let me know if you need the password), and we'll be on Zoom from 6:30-8. 

## Local Situation
Things look generally good, with a slight asterisk that we're down to low enough prevalences (and therefore sample sizes) that we're back to the pattern that we had early on, with significant shifts every Saturday/Sunday (after the big national models update on Friday/Saturday), and essentially just noise in between. Today's daily and rolling average figures are the lowest since daily data became available in September, by quite some margin.
The graph of our exposure risk is still based on age case distribution and contact rate data from before Easter, because I haven't had time to go through the age-specific modelling and work through the details. This is likely to lead to something of an overestimate of the risk for most sections, but an underestimate of the risk for the Scout sections (due to how many people have moved up from Cubs to Scouts recently). Regardless, all risks are still very low and falling rapidly.

## Our Risk Profile

This finally got updated. I've also cleaned things up, merging down to a single line per section (light blue: Beavers, brown: Tigers, green: Panthers, dark blue: Tuesday Scouts, purple: Thursday Scouts, red: Explorers). This is still based on the last meeting before Christmas, and has been affected by the messiness of local figures recently, so should be taken with an even larger pinch of salt than usual.
