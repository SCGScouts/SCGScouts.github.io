# Weekly Update

## This Week

With the change back to a tier system, we're now allowed to meet up in person again. This week, we're keeping things simple, and going for various walks with all of the sections except Explorers (Explorers, check your facebook group for details). We're likely to have to split at least some of the groups again, so please make sure to sign up on OSM (you should have just had an email about that). We'll all be meeting at the normal times, but in a variety of places: 

| Section | Location | Second location if we need to split |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beavers | Scout Hut | Knavesmire Entrance |
| Cubs | Scout Hut | Millennium Bridge |
| Tuesday Scouts | Scout Hut | Millennium Bridge |
| Thursday Scouts | Scout Hut | Millennium Bridge | 

We are likely to be short on leaders for some sections if we do need to split them. At a guess, we're likely to need (assuming that we need to split both sets of Cubs and Tuesday Scouts, and have similar-ish numbers to the last time we met up in person): 

- 1 or 2 parent helpers for Monday Cubs
- 1 parent helper for Beavers
- 2 parent helpers for Tuesday Scouts
- 1 parent helper for Thursday Cubs
- 1 parent helper for Thursday Scouts

As always, please let us know (either by email, or the [Worry Box](https://stchadsscouts.com/worrybox), or whatever else is easiest) if there's anything we can do to help your kids deal with everything that is going on. 

## Local Situation

This week, we've levelled off significantly - this is likely the move to the tier system kicking in. The fact that it's still broadly level or downwards is very good news.

## Our Risk Profile

These are now based on actual attendance last week, so are actually meaningful again. They're also the lowest we've had since September for most sections. 

| Section  | Current risk | Risk on meeting day (projected) |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Beavers A  | 1.3% | 1.2% |
| Beavers B | 0.9% | 0.8% |
| Tigers (Combined) | 1.6% | 1.5% |
| Panthers A | 1.8% | 1.6% |
| Panthers B | 1.7% | 1.6% |
| Tuesday Scouts A | 2.2% | 2.1% |
| Tuesday Scouts B | 1.6% | 1.5% |
| Thursday Scouts | 2.5% | 2.3% |
| Explorers | 1.6% | 1.5% |
