# Weekly Update

## This Week

| Section | Locations | Activity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beavers | Clifford's Tower | Chippy/Christmas Lights walk |
| Cubs | Nunnery Lane Car Park/Millennium Bridge | Chippy/Christmas Lights walk |
| Scouts | Clifford's Tower/Nunnery Lane Car Parks | Christmas-y walk |

Uniforms and generally Christmas-y hats/etc. highly recommended.

Finally, Jo will be delivering a bunch of cards/pictures/etc. to a local care home next week. If anybody has any cards/etc. they'd like to add to that, please bring them along to any meeting this week. 

## Local Situation

This week, we've levelled off significantly - this is likely the move to the tier system kicking in. The fact that it's still broadly level or downwards is very good news.
