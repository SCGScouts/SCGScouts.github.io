# Back to meeting in person (again)

## General Summary

With the lockdown changes coming in next week, we're going to be able to meet up in person again. Things will be broadly the same as they were in the summer/autumn, with a few minor changes, of which the only one that's really relevant is that we aren't strictly limited to group sizes of 15 any more. We'll still be keeping numbers down as much as we can, and might end up splitting groups up more, depending on how local case numbers go. However, this means that the sections that were tending to be marginal on whether or not they needed splitting until the last minute (especially Monday Cubs and Beavers)
will be easier to work with, so we shouldn't need last-minute emails with groups and locations. We'll still be using the OSM events page so that you can sign up, and it would be very helpful if you could sign up in advance where possible. 

For those who weren't with us last year, here's a quick summary:

1. We will need explicit consent from you before your child attends (including Young Leaders attending meetings of other sections, as a separate thing from them attending Explorers). We'll be doing this via OSM events - you should have had an invite to that event. 
1. We will be meeting outdoors (it looks like we'll probably be allowed to start meeting indoors from April, with some restrictions, but we'll be staying outdoors as much as possible for as long as possible, both to avoid having to work with those restrictions and the number limits from how small our hut is, and to make the best of the (hopefully!) improving weather.
2. During the meetings (and at pickups/dropoffs), we'll be asking everybody to socially distance from each other. We're aware that this will be difficult for many of them, especially for the younger ones, and we aren't expecting it to b, but we will be trying our best in that regard. 
3. Not something that you're likely to notice, but we'll be avoiding sharing equipment as much as possible, and cleaning it where we can't avoid it. 
4. We'll be doing all of the now-usual handwashing and such.
5. We will be keeping track of who has attended, and will pass this information to test & trace if requested. 
6. We still can't go camping yet, and there's no word on exactly when that will change. I'm reasonably optimistic about us being able to go camping in the summer, though.
7. Most of our bad weather plans are of the form "do the same thing, but wear coats". However, if it gets excessively awful, there may well be last-minute changes to the plan - please bear with us with that kind of thing.
8. We're going to keep going through school holidays for now.

We will also very likely be needing some help from you guys too - we're OK for the first week (if anybody wants to join us for a walk, you're more than welcome, of course), but we will get a parent rota setup organised, probably along similar lines to what we had going last year. 

## New People

Those of you who haven't been with us in person before should have had an email with (a) information about the system that we'll be using for letting you sign up for events (and basically all of the rest of our admin stuff), and information about stuff that you need to do. If you haven't had such an email, please let me know so I can fix it (including if you have other children that are already set up). 

## Moving Sections

We've been putting off moving people between sections for a while, and have now accumulated quite the backlog of people who are of the right age to move up, if they'd like to (I make it 40, across the group!). If any of yours fall into that category (that is: Beavers over 7.5, Cubs over 10, Scouts over 13.5), you'll be getting another email about that. We still won't be pushing people to move up if they aren't keen on the ideal, will keep people in groups with their friends, and will stagger the moves out somewhat to avoid overloading the sections that are getting lots of people moving in, so it's likely to take a while. If anybody is keen to move up quickly, though, let us know and we'll move them up first.

## Activities

We'll be starting off simple, and all going for hikes this week. You should all have been invited to the relevant OSM events for it. The programme going forwards should be out early next week.

## Other Stuff

You can find our full risk assessment [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xCxB79aQMd_lLrEOvQGS21v6oo3X6EOG63JHqZyn220/edit?usp=sharing), the national guidance [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/scouts-at-home/getting-everyone-back-together-safely/), and the original information [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqTfBxeBgpflv29CxinNBOWz3u_f4b7i6Z37812jcas/edit#), but hopefully everything directly relevant is here. 

We will still be running some online things, as well as the in-person meetings, if there is demand for it. If you/your children have any preferences as to what you'd like those sessions to look like, please let us know (I'm aware that I still owe you some more chess, so that will happen at some point).

If your child has any special needs that might need us to make any adjustments, please talk to us and we’ll do everything we can. 

We are aware that we have some members who are, or have family members who are, particularly vulnerable to this disease. If this applies to you, please talk to us about how we can help you/your children, either in-person or virtually. 

If your child is finding everything that is going on difficult, please let us know, and we’ll do whatever we can to help them through this. 

If you have any feedback or questions about this survey, this document, our risk assessment, or anything else about the arrangements, please let us know.
